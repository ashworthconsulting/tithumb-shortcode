Timthumb Shortcode
=================

Have you ever grown frustrated at the lack of easy, on-the-fly cropping and image manipulation options in Wordpress when authoring a post or a page? Wordpress' built-in tools are okay for simple pages, but when you need to get highly specific with pixels, crops, etc, Wordpress' tools just make things harder...rather than easier.

This is a TimThumb shortcode for Wordpress. It's been tested and confirmed working up to Wordpress 3.6.1.

All you need to do is copy the PHP code into your theme's `functions.php` file and you're good to go! Optionally, you may simply upload the PHP file via FTP or checkout this repo via Git and include the file into your `functions.php` file.

I hope this has helped somebody out there and that it has been found useful!

**Note:**

*If any of you are able to test on higher versions and report back that it's working, that would be great. A split in priorities has had me preoccupied lately on other projects.*
